## Market Analysis

### Target Audience Deep Dive

- **Psychographics:**
  - Anxious about admission outcomes
  - Overwhelmed by information fragmentation
  - Seeking guidance and validation
  - Mobile-first digital natives
  - Price-sensitive but willing to pay for value
  - Influenced by peer recommendations

- **Pain Points:**
  - Fear of missing application deadlines
  - Uncertainty about cutoff scores and eligibility
  - Lack of trusted guidance
  - Hidden costs and surprises
  - Information overload from multiple sources

- **Aspirations:**
  - Get admitted to a reputable institution
  - Study a program that leads to good jobs
  - Make parents proud
  - Avoid costly mistakes

**Secondary Segment: Parents/Guardians (35-55 years)**

**Tertiary Segment: School Counselors (30-50 years)**

### Competitive Landscape

**Current State:**
- No dominant player in Nigerian education data
- Fragmented information across institutional websites
- JAMB provides only exam services, not guidance
- Education consultancies are expensive (₦50k-₦200k)
- Word-of-mouth and seniors are primary sources

**Opportunity:**
- **Blue Ocean Strategy** - Create a new category: "Educational Decision Platform"
- Not competing with JAMB (exam body) or universities (providers)
- Competing with: ignorance, misinformation, expensive consultants

**Threat Analysis:**
- JAMB could launch competing service (low likelihood - not their core business)
- Well-funded edtech startups could pivot into this space
- Universities could band together to create official platform
