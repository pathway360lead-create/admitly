## Introduction

This document contains three distinct video scripts for the Admitly marketing campaign. Each script is designed to be a short, emotionally resonant video (30-60 seconds) suitable for social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.

The scripts are based on a deep understanding of the target audience's pain points and aspirations, as detailed in the `prd.md` and `branding-strategy.md` documents.

**Core Creative Principles:**
*   **Authenticity:** Use real-looking Nigerian students, not models.
*   **Emotion-Driven:** Focus on feelings, not just features.
*   **Cinematic Quality:** High-quality visuals and sound design.
*   **Clear Call-to-Action:** Drive viewers to join the waitlist.

| **Scene** | **Visuals** | **Audio/Sound Design** | **On-Screen Text** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT** <br> Close-up on a young student's face (CHIDINMA, 18), illuminated only by her phone screen. She looks exhausted and worried. We see reflections of scrolling text in her eyes. | (Sound of frantic, overlapping whispers) "JAMB score...", "Cutoff marks...", "Did I choose the right subjects?", "My parents are counting on me..." | |
| **2** | **SLOW-MOTION** <br> Chidinma stands up. As she does, invisible weights seem to press down on her shoulders. Her posture is slumped. The room feels dark and claustrophobic. | (A low, heavy, bass hum intensifies) | |
| **3** | **MATCH CUT** <br> Chidinma is now walking through a crowded market. Everyone is moving at normal speed, but she is in slow motion, still carrying the invisible weight. People bump past her. She looks lost and alone. | (Market sounds are muffled, distant. The whispers continue, louder now.) | The pressure is real. |
| **4.A** | **INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT** <br> Back in her room. Chidinma slumps into her chair, looking defeated. She's about to put her phone down. | (Music shifts. A single, gentle piano note is heard.) | |
| **4.B** | Her thumb hovers, then taps on a notification. The screen shows the Admitly logo and the text: "Your path to admission is clear." | (The whispers and bass hum fade instantly. The piano melody begins, soft and hopeful.) | |
| **5** | **CLOSE UP - EYES** <br> A wave of relief washes over Chidinma's face. Her eyes, once filled with worry, now show a glimmer of hope. The phone's light is now warm and inviting. | (Uplifting piano score swells.) | |
| **6** | **WIDE SHOT** <br> Chidinma stands up straight, the invisible weight gone. The room is now brighter. She looks confident. On her phone screen, we see a clear, simple interface showing her top university matches. | (Sound of a gentle, affirming "swoosh".) | Find your future, with confidence. |
| **7** | **FINAL SCENE** <br> White screen with the Admitly logo. | (Music reaches a crescendo and then fades softly.) | **Admitly** <br> Get Admitted, Confidently. <br> **Join the waitlist.** <br> admitly.com.ng |

## Video 2: "The Maze"

**Concept:** This video portrays the admission process as a confusing, overwhelming maze of information, with Admitly as the clear path through it.

**Target Emotion:** Confusion, Overwhelm, Clarity
**Target Audience:** Students, Parents
**Style:** Fast-paced, dynamic, with quick cuts and a sense of controlled chaos that resolves into calm.
**Music:** Starts with a fast, complex, slightly jarring electronic beat. Transitions to a clean, modern, and rhythmic synth track.

| **Scene** | **Visuals** | **Audio/Sound Design** | **On-Screen Text** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **OPENING SHOT** <br> A student (IBRAHIM, 19) stands at the entrance of a massive, stylized maze made of floating screens, books, and papers with university logos. He looks overwhelmed. | (Fast, complex electronic music starts abruptly. Sound of rustling paper, clicks, and notification pings.) | |
| **2** | **QUICK CUTS** <br> - Ibrahim takes a path, hits a dead end marked "Deadline Passed". <br> - He looks at a screen with conflicting "Cutoff Scores". <br> - He's surrounded by floating, confusing text: "Post-UTME", "Accreditation?", "Hidden Fees". <br> - He runs his hands through his hair in frustration. | (The music gets more intense. Overlapping, distorted voices reading out different university requirements.) | Feeling lost? |
| **3** | **AERIAL SHOT** <br> We pull up to see the vast, impossible maze. Ibrahim is a tiny figure lost within it. | (Music and chaotic sounds peak.) | |
| **4** | **CLOSE UP** <br> Ibrahim pulls out his phone. He types "admitly.com.ng" into the browser. The screen glows with the **Success Blue** of the Admitly brand. | (The chaotic music cuts out suddenly. A clean, modern synth note holds.) | |
| **5** | **MATCH CUT** <br> As he taps the screen, a glowing blue line appears on the floor of the maze, showing him the direct path forward. The chaotic floating screens and papers retract and disappear. | (A smooth, satisfying "whoosh" sound. The new, rhythmic synth track begins.) | We clear the path. |
| **6** | **DYNAMIC SHOTS** <br> Ibrahim walks confidently along the glowing path. As he walks, key information appears neatly beside him in the Admitly UI: <br> - "YABATECH: Application Open" <br> - "Total Cost: ₦150,000" <br> - "Your Eligibility: 95%" | (The music is upbeat and confident.) | All the info. <br> One clear path. |
| **7** | **FINAL SCENE** <br> Ibrahim emerges from the maze into a bright, open space. He smiles, relieved and confident. He looks directly at the camera. | (Music fades with a final, positive synth chord.) | **Admitly** <br> Admission Made Simple. <br> **Join the waitlist.** <br> admitly.com.ng |
