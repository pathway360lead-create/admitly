### Data Collection Pipeline

**Scraping Strategy:**
- **Frequency:**
  - High-change (deadlines, admissions): Daily during admission season, weekly off-season
  - Moderate-change (fees, programs): Biweekly
  - Low-change (profiles, contacts): Quarterly
- **Technology:** Scrapy (structured data) + Playwright (JavaScript-heavy sites)
- **Politeness:**
  - Respect robots.txt
  - Rate limiting (1-2 req/second per domain)
  - Randomized user agents
  - Request delays (2-5 seconds)
  - Off-peak hours scraping
- **Storage:** HTML snapshots stored in Supabase Storage for debugging

**Data Normalization:**
- Standardize dates (ISO 8601)
- Convert currency to kobo (₦1 = 100 kobo)
- Normalize phone numbers (+234 format)
- Clean and trim text fields
- Extract structured data from unstructured text

**Data Validation:**
- Schema validation (Pydantic models)
- Business rule validation (reasonable ranges)
- Duplicate detection (content hashing)
- Link validation (check URLs)
- Conflict detection (e.g., fee changed >20%)

**Staging & Approval Workflow:**
1. Scraped data lands in `staging_*` tables
2. Automated validation checks
3. Flagged items go to review queue (admin portal)
4. Admin approves/rejects with notes
5. Approved data promoted to production tables
6. Change logged in `change_log` table
7. Search index updated (Meilisearch)
8. Subscribers notified (if relevant)

**Data Quality KPIs:**
- **Freshness:** >85% of pages updated within SLA
- **Completeness:** >90% of required fields populated
- **Accuracy:** <5% discrepancy rate vs official sources
- **Timeliness:** <72 hours from change detection to publish

**Full Pipeline Spec:** See `/specs/data-pipeline.md`

### Data Governance

**Ethical Scraping:**
- Only scrape publicly accessible pages
- No login bypass or CAPTCHA circumvention
- Honor robots.txt and meta tags
- Attribute data sources with links
- Respect institution takedown requests
- Cache only summaries, link to originals

**Legal Compliance:**
- Fair use of publicly available data
- No copyright infringement
- Clear disclaimers about third-party data
- Institutional verification workflow
- Terms of service for platform usage

**Data Retention:**
- User data: Retained until account deletion (NDPR compliance)
- Scraped data: Retained indefinitely with version history
- HTML snapshots: 90-day retention for debugging
- Search history: 1-year retention (or user-requested deletion)
- Change logs: Permanent audit trail

- **Likelihood:** Medium (JAMB could build similar product)
- **Mitigation:**
  - First-mover advantage (speed to market)
  - Superior UX (mobile-first, fast)
  - AI differentiation (incumbents lack AI)
  - Network effects (more users = better data)
  - Institutional partnerships (exclusive data)
  - Continuous innovation (features, quality)

### Operational Risks

**Risk 9: Founder Burnout**
- **Impact:** Product stagnation, quality decline
- **Likelihood:** Medium (solo founder, high workload)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Sustainable work schedule (avoid burnout)
  - Outsource non-core tasks (design, content)
  - Hire contractors for scraping (as needed)
  - Automate repetitive tasks
  - Community support (forums, volunteer moderators)
  - Focus on Phase 1 MVP first (avoid scope creep)

**Risk 10: Data Breach or Security Incident**
- **Impact:** User data compromised, legal penalties, brand damage
- **Likelihood:** Low (strong security measures)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Security best practices (OWASP Top 10)
  - Regular security audits
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - RLS policies on all tables
  - Secrets in environment variables (never in code)
  - Incident response plan documented
  - Cyber insurance policy

# Section 2: Creative Assets

This section contains the production-ready scripts for the video marketing campaign.

## 2.1. Video Marketing Campaign Scripts

**Prepared by:** Brand Strategist & Cinematographer
**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Production

---

### Introduction

This document contains three distinct video scripts for the Admitly marketing campaign. Each script is designed to be a short, emotionally resonant video (30-60 seconds) suitable for social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.

The scripts are based on a deep understanding of the target audience's pain points and aspirations, as detailed in the `prd.md` and `branding-strategy.md` documents.

**Core Creative Principles:**
*   **Authenticity:** Use real-looking Nigerian students, not models.
*   **Emotion-Driven:** Focus on feelings, not just features.
*   **Cinematic Quality:** High-quality visuals and sound design.
*   **Clear Call-to-Action:** Drive viewers to join the waitlist.

### Video 1: "The Weight"

**Concept:** This video visualizes the emotional weight and pressure of the admission process, showing how Admitly lifts that burden.

**Target Emotion:** Anxiety, Pressure, Hope
**Target Audience:** Students, Parents
**Style:** Cinematic, dramatic, slow-motion, with a powerful emotional arc.
**Music:** Starts with a low, tense, ambient sound. Swells into a hopeful, uplifting piano score.

| **Scene** | **Visuals** | **Audio/Sound Design** | **On-Screen Text** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT** <br> Close-up on a young student's face (CHIDINMA, 18), illuminated only by her phone screen. She looks exhausted and worried. We see reflections of scrolling text in her eyes. | (Sound of frantic, overlapping whispers) "JAMB score...", "Cutoff marks...", "Did I choose the right subjects?", "My parents are counting on me..." | |
| **2** | **SLOW-MOTION** <br> Chidinma stands up. As she does, invisible weights seem to press down on her shoulders. Her posture is slumped. The room feels dark and claustrophobic. | (A low, heavy, bass hum intensifies) | |
| **3** | **MATCH CUT** <br> Chidinma is now walking through a crowded market. Everyone is moving at normal speed, but she is in slow motion, still carrying the invisible weight. People bump past her. She looks lost and alone. | (Market sounds are muffled, distant. The whispers continue, louder now.) | The pressure is real. |
| **4.A** | **INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT** <br> Back in her room. Chidinma slumps into her chair, looking defeated. She's about to put her phone down. | (Music shifts. A single, gentle piano note is heard.) | |
| **4.B** | Her thumb hovers, then taps on a notification. The screen shows the Admitly logo and the text: "Your path to admission is clear." | (The whispers and bass hum fade instantly. The piano melody begins, soft and hopeful.) | |
| **5** | **CLOSE UP - EYES** <br> A wave of relief washes over Chidinma's face. Her eyes, once filled with worry, now show a glimmer of hope. The phone's light is now warm and inviting. | (Uplifting piano score swells.) | |
| **6** | **WIDE SHOT** <br> Chidinma stands up straight, the invisible weight gone. The room is now brighter. She looks confident. On her phone screen, we see a clear, simple interface showing her top university matches. | (Sound of a gentle, affirming "swoosh".) | Find your future, with confidence. |
| **7** | **FINAL SCENE** <br> White screen with the Admitly logo. | (Music reaches a crescendo and then fades softly.) | **Admitly** <br> Get Admitted, Confidently. <br> **Join the waitlist.** <br> admitly.com.ng |

### Video 2: "The Maze"

**Concept:** This video portrays the admission process as a confusing, overwhelming maze of information, with Admitly as the clear path through it.

**Target Emotion:** Confusion, Overwhelm, Clarity
**Target Audience:** Students, Parents
**Style:** Fast-paced, dynamic, with quick cuts and a sense of controlled chaos that resolves into calm.
**Music:** Starts with a fast, complex, slightly jarring electronic beat. Transitions to a clean, modern, and rhythmic synth track.

| **Scene** | **Visuals** | **Audio/Sound Design** | **On-Screen Text** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **OPENING SHOT** <br> A student (IBRAHIM, 19) stands at the entrance of a massive, stylized maze made of floating screens, books, and papers with university logos. He looks overwhelmed. | (Fast, complex electronic music starts abruptly. Sound of rustling paper, clicks, and notification pings.) | |
| **2** | **QUICK CUTS** <br> - Ibrahim takes a path, hits a dead end marked "Deadline Passed". <br> - He looks at a screen with conflicting "Cutoff Scores". <br> - He's surrounded by floating, confusing text: "Post-UTME", "Accreditation?", "Hidden Fees". <br> - He runs his hands through his hair in frustration. | (The music gets more intense. Overlapping, distorted voices reading out different university requirements.) | Feeling lost? |
| **3** | **AERIAL SHOT** <br> We pull up to see the vast, impossible maze. Ibrahim is a tiny figure lost within it. | (Music and chaotic sounds peak.) | |
| **4** | **CLOSE UP** <br> Ibrahim pulls out his phone. He types "admitly.com.ng" into the browser. The screen glows with the **Success Blue** of the Admitly brand. | (The chaotic music cuts out suddenly. A clean, modern synth note holds.) | |
| **5** | **MATCH CUT** <br> As he taps the screen, a glowing blue line appears on the floor of the maze, showing him the direct path forward. The chaotic floating screens and papers retract and disappear. | (A smooth, satisfying "whoosh" sound. The new, rhythmic synth track begins.) | We clear the path. |
| **6** | **DYNAMIC SHOTS** <br> Ibrahim walks confidently along the glowing path. As he walks, key information appears neatly beside him in the Admitly UI: <br> - "YABATECH: Application Open" <br> - "Total Cost: ₦150,000" <br> - "Your Eligibility: 95%" | (The music is upbeat and confident.) | All the info. <br> One clear path. |
| **7** | **FINAL SCENE** <br> Ibrahim emerges from the maze into a bright, open space. He smiles, relieved and confident. He looks directly at the camera. | (Music fades with a final, positive synth chord.) | **Admitly** <br> Admission Made Simple. <br> **Join the waitlist.** <br> admitly.com.ng |

The sound of a turning page.) | It's more than just an exam. |
| **2** | **MONTAGE - THE STRUGGLE** <br> Quick, authentic shots of the hard work: <br> - Studying late at night, a single lamp on. <br> - A group of friends quizzing each other. <br> - A moment of doubt, quickly overcome by determination. | (The music builds slightly in intensity, adding a layer of strings.) | It's a promise. |
| **3** | **THE TURNING POINT** <br> A student is on her phone, using the Admitly app. The interface is clean and encouraging. We see a "Congratulations! You are eligible for 15 programs" message. A genuine, unforced smile spreads across her face. | (The music swells, becoming more powerful and uplifting.) | A dream for your future. |

They embrace in a heartfelt hug. <br> - The student confidently walking onto a beautiful university campus. <br> - Laughing with new friends. <br> - Looking up at a university building with a sense of belonging. | (The music soars. The sounds of joyful celebration and laughter are mixed in subtly.) | Don't let uncertainty hold you back. |
